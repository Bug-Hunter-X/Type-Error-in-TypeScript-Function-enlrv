This repository demonstrates a common type error in TypeScript and its solution.  The `bug.ts` file shows code that attempts to pass an array of strings to a function expecting a single string, resulting in a type error. The `bugSolution.ts` file provides a corrected version of the code.  This example highlights the importance of type checking in TypeScript and demonstrates how to handle type mismatches effectively.
